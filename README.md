# Problem

Github has [neat statistics](https://github.com/facebook/react/graphs/contributors) for contributors, it shows number of commits and nice charts. But people contribute to Github projects not only via commits, actually a lot of contributions happens in issue or pull request comments. Github doesn't have statistics to show "top commenters", we think those people also deserve recognition. 

## Task
Fortunately Gihub has a [great API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/comments/) to help with that.

## Setup

We provide a basic project setup, so you don't have to worry about setting up our environment. You would need to obtain and use your access key.

To get started:

- fork this repository
